Task 1 project explanation:

This program implements a “4-for-3” pizza offer by repeatedly asking the user for four valid (positive) pizza prices, checking each input with a loop and error handling to avoid invalid entries, storing them in a list, and then calculating the total by subtracting the cheapest pizza from the sum of all four; it also computes the discount as a percentage of the original total using math.ceil to round up. The main() function coordinates everything by collecting the prices, calling the calculation function, and finally printing the discounted total and the percentage saved in a formatted message.



TASK 2 project explanation:

This Python program simulates a simple password verification system by first requiring the user to enter a password that is at least 9 characters long, then performing three random security checks where the user must correctly re-enter specific characters from their password based on randomly chosen positions. If the password is too short or any character entered during the checks is incorrect, the program immediately terminates and denies access; if all three checks are passed successfully, the program confirms that the security check has passed and grants access.
