This program implements a “4-for-3” pizza offer by repeatedly asking the user for four valid (positive) pizza prices, checking each input with a loop and error handling to avoid invalid entries, storing them in a list, and then calculating the total by subtracting the cheapest pizza from the sum of all four; it also computes the discount as a percentage of the original total using `math.ceil` to round up. The `main()` function coordinates everything by collecting the prices, calling the calculation function, and finally printing the discounted total and the percentage saved in a formatted message.
