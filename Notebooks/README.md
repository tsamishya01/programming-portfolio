WEEK 2 :

These programs all take input from the user, process it, and then display a result. The first program asks for the user’s name using `input()`, stores it in a variable called `name`, and then uses an f-string in `print()` to display a friendly greeting that includes that name. The second program asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, converts this input to a `float` so it can handle decimal values, applies the formula `F = (C × 9/5) + 32` to convert it to Fahrenheit, and then prints both the original and converted temperatures. The third program asks for the number of students and the desired group size, uses integer division (`//`) to calculate how many full groups can be formed and the modulus operator (`%`) to find how many students are left over, and then uses an `if` statement to print a grammatically correct message depending on whether one or more students remain. The fourth program asks for the number of sweets and pupils, uses `//` to work out how many sweets each pupil gets and `%` to find how many are left over, and finally prints both results.


WEEK 3 :

All of these programs use user input, decisions (`if`, `elif`, `else`), and sometimes loops to control how the program behaves. The first one asks for a name and checks whether the user entered nothing; if the input is empty it greets “Stranger,” otherwise it greets the name provided. Questions 2–5 are progressively more advanced password checkers: they ask the user to enter a password twice, first simply checking that both entries match, then also checking that the password length is between 8 and 12 characters, then additionally rejecting common “bad” passwords from a list, and finally repeating this process in a `while True` loop until a valid password is set. Question 6 uses a `for` loop with `range(13)` to print the 7 times table from 0 to 12. Question 7 asks the user for a number between 0 and 12, checks that it is within this range, and if so prints that number’s multiplication table from 0 to 12. Question 8 is similar but allows numbers from -12 to 12; if the number is negative it converts it to positive using `abs()` and prints the table in reverse order (from 12 down to 0), otherwise it prints the table in the normal forward order, and in all cases it displays an error message if the input is outside the allowed range.


WEEK 4 :

These programs introduce functions, string handling, and simple data processing: the first defines a function `in_range_0_100` that returns `True` if a number is between 0 and 100 (inclusive) and then tests it on several values; the second defines `count_case`, which counts uppercase and lowercase letters in a string using generator expressions and returns both counts; the third asks for a name, capitalizes it with `.capitalize()` if one is given, or greets “Stranger” if the input is empty; the fourth defines a function that removes the last character of a string (unless it is very short) using slicing; the fifth provides two small conversion functions between Celsius and Fahrenheit and demonstrates them with examples; the sixth reads a temperature like “20C”, checks that it ends with “C”, converts the numeric part to Fahrenheit, and errors otherwise; question 7 collects exactly six Celsius temperatures into a list and then uses the `statistics` module to print the maximum, minimum, and mean; and question 8 generalizes this by repeatedly collecting temperatures until the user presses Enter, then computing the same statistics if any values were entered or reporting that none were given.


WEEK 5 :

These programs all demonstrate using Python’s standard library and command-line arguments via `sys.argv`. The first script takes a URL from the command line, checks that one was provided, and then tries to open it with `urllib.request`; if successful it prints the website’s HTTP status, otherwise it reports that the site is not reachable along with the error. Question 1 simply prints the operating system platform using `sys.platform`. Question 2 counts how many command-line arguments (excluding the script name) were provided and prints that number. Question 3 collects all arguments, reports if none were given, otherwise sorts them by length and prints the shortest one. Question 5 treats command-line arguments as temperatures ending in “C”, filters out invalid ones, converts the valid values to floats, and then reports the maximum, minimum, and mean using the `statistics` module (or says if none were valid). Question 6 implements a simple backup utility: it checks that a filename was provided and that the file exists, then uses `shutil.copy` to create a backup with a “.bak” extension and reports the new file.


WEEK 6 :

These programs focus on functions, error handling, and basic algorithms. The first defines `to_binary`, which raises an error for negative numbers and otherwise uses Python’s built-in `bin()` to convert an integer to a binary string without the “0b” prefix. The second defines a `factors` function that checks every number from 1 to *n* and collects those that divide *n* evenly into a list. The third defines `is_prime`, which rejects numbers ≤ 1 and then only tests divisibility up to the square root of *n* for efficiency, returning `True` only for prime numbers. The fourth “encryption” function removes spaces from a message and reverses the remaining characters using slicing. The fifth generates a simple obfuscation by choosing a random interval, inserting that many random lowercase letters after each real character, and returning both the encrypted text and the interval used. The sixth is meant to reverse this process by taking every *interval*-th character from the encrypted message to recover the original text.


WEEEK 7 :

These programs all work with collections such as sets, dictionaries, and counters. The first converts a word into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts it alphabetically to return a list of unique letters. Question 2 uses set operations to compare two words: union gives all letters appearing in either word, intersection gives only the letters they share, and symmetric difference gives letters that appear in one word but not both. Question 3 builds up a dictionary of countries and capitals in a loop, storing keys in lowercase for consistency, retrieving known capitals when possible, and asking the user to supply and save new ones when they are unknown. Question 4 uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how often each letter appears in a message (ignoring case and non-letters) and returns the six most frequent letters along with their counts.


WEEK 8 :

These programs are simple command-line utilities that work with files and text. The first (“nl”) reads a filename from the command line, opens the file, and prints each line with a line number in front of it, or shows an error if the file does not exist. Question 2 (“diff”) takes two filenames, reads both files completely, and reports whether their contents are identical or different. Question 3 (“grep”) searches a file for a given pattern and prints only the lines that contain that pattern. Question 4 (“wc”) opens a file and counts how many lines it contains and how many characters in total, then prints both counts. Question 5 (“spell”) loads a dictionary of valid words into a set, then reads another file word by word, cleans punctuation and converts words to lowercase, and prints any words that are not found in the dictionary, effectively acting as a simple spell checker.
