These programs focus on functions, error handling, and basic algorithms. The first defines `to_binary`, which raises an error for negative numbers and otherwise uses Python’s built-in `bin()` to convert an integer to a binary string without the “0b” prefix. The second defines a `factors` function that checks every number from 1 to *n* and collects those that divide *n* evenly into a list. The third defines `is_prime`, which rejects numbers ≤ 1 and then only tests divisibility up to the square root of *n* for efficiency, returning `True` only for prime numbers. The fourth “encryption” function removes spaces from a message and reverses the remaining characters using slicing. The fifth generates a simple obfuscation by choosing a random interval, inserting that many random lowercase letters after each real character, and returning both the encrypted text and the interval used. The sixth is meant to reverse this process by taking every *interval*-th character from the encrypted message to recover the original text.
