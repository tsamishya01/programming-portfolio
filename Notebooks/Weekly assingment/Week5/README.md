These programs all demonstrate using Python’s standard library and command-line arguments via `sys.argv`. The first script takes a URL from the command line, checks that one was provided, and then tries to open it with `urllib.request`; if successful it prints the website’s HTTP status, otherwise it reports that the site is not reachable along with the error. Question 1 simply prints the operating system platform using `sys.platform`. Question 2 counts how many command-line arguments (excluding the script name) were provided and prints that number. Question 3 collects all arguments, reports if none were given, otherwise sorts them by length and prints the shortest one. Question 5 treats command-line arguments as temperatures ending in “C”, filters out invalid ones, converts the valid values to floats, and then reports the maximum, minimum, and mean using the `statistics` module (or says if none were valid). Question 6 implements a simple backup utility: it checks that a filename was provided and that the file exists, then uses `shutil.copy` to create a backup with a “.bak” extension and reports the new file.
