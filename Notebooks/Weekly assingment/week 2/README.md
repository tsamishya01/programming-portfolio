These programs all take input from the user, process it, and then display a result. The first program asks for the user’s name using `input()`, stores it in a variable called `name`, and then uses an f-string in `print()` to display a friendly greeting that includes that name. The second program asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius, converts this input to a `float` so it can handle decimal values, applies the formula `F = (C × 9/5) + 32` to convert it to Fahrenheit, and then prints both the original and converted temperatures. The third program asks for the number of students and the desired group size, uses integer division (`//`) to calculate how many full groups can be formed and the modulus operator (`%`) to find how many students are left over, and then uses an `if` statement to print a grammatically correct message depending on whether one or more students remain. The fourth program asks for the number of sweets and pupils, uses `//` to work out how many sweets each pupil gets and `%` to find how many are left over, and finally prints both results.
