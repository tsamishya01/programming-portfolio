These programs all work with collections such as sets, dictionaries, and counters. The first converts a word into a set to remove duplicates, then sorts it alphabetically to return a list of unique letters. Question 2 uses set operations to compare two words: union gives all letters appearing in either word, intersection gives only the letters they share, and symmetric difference gives letters that appear in one word but not both. Question 3 builds up a dictionary of countries and capitals in a loop, storing keys in lowercase for consistency, retrieving known capitals when possible, and asking the user to supply and save new ones when they are unknown. Question 4 uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how often each letter appears in a message (ignoring case and non-letters) and returns the six most frequent letters along with their counts.
