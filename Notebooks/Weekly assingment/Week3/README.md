All of these programs use user input, decisions (if, elif, else), and sometimes loops to control how the program behaves. The first one asks for a name and checks whether the user entered nothing; if the input is empty it greets “Stranger,” otherwise it greets the name provided. Questions 2–5 are progressively more advanced password checkers: they ask the user to enter a password twice, first simply checking that both entries match, then also checking that the password length is between 8 and 12 characters, then additionally rejecting common “bad” passwords from a list, and finally repeating this process in a while True loop until a valid password is set. Question 6 uses a for loop with range(13) to print the 7 times table from 0 to 12. Question 7 asks the user for a number between 0 and 12, checks that it is within this range, and if so prints that number’s multiplication table from 0 to 12. Question 8 is similar but allows numbers from -12 to 12; if the number is negative it converts it to positive using abs() and prints the table in reverse order (from 12 down to 0), otherwise it prints the table in the normal forward order, and in all cases it displays an error message if the input is outside the allowed range.
