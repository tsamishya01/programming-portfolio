These programs introduce functions, string handling, and simple data processing: the first defines a function `in_range_0_100` that returns `True` if a number is between 0 and 100 (inclusive) and then tests it on several values; the second defines `count_case`, which counts uppercase and lowercase letters in a string using generator expressions and returns both counts; the third asks for a name, capitalizes it with `.capitalize()` if one is given, or greets “Stranger” if the input is empty; the fourth defines a function that removes the last character of a string (unless it is very short) using slicing; the fifth provides two small conversion functions between Celsius and Fahrenheit and demonstrates them with examples; the sixth reads a temperature like “20C”, checks that it ends with “C”, converts the numeric part to Fahrenheit, and errors otherwise; question 7 collects exactly six Celsius temperatures into a list and then uses the `statistics` module to print the maximum, minimum, and mean; and question 8 generalizes this by repeatedly collecting temperatures until the user presses Enter, then computing the same statistics if any values were entered or reporting that none were given.
