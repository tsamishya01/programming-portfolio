These programs are simple command-line utilities that work with files and text. The first (“nl”) reads a filename from the command line, opens the file, and prints each line with a line number in front of it, or shows an error if the file does not exist. Question 2 (“diff”) takes two filenames, reads both files completely, and reports whether their contents are identical or different. Question 3 (“grep”) searches a file for a given pattern and prints only the lines that contain that pattern. Question 4 (“wc”) opens a file and counts how many lines it contains and how many characters in total, then prints both counts. Question 5 (“spell”) loads a dictionary of valid words into a set, then reads another file word by word, cleans punctuation and converts words to lowercase, and prints any words that are not found in the dictionary, effectively acting as a simple spell checker.
